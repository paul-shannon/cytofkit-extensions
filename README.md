# CytofkitNormalization.R

A simple R6 package which
 
  - reads the standard results file produced by cytofkit
  - adds new columns to the matrix contained therein, normalizing
    marker values against H3 and/or H4 "total" histone values.
    

See Alex Kuo, Cell, 2018 (I will track down the reference more precisely.)
