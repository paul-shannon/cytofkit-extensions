# CytofkitNormalization

![alttag](images/h3Normalization.png)

An R6 package which
 
  - reads the standard results file produced by cytofkit
  - adds new columns to the matrix contained therein, normalizing
    marker values against H3 and/or H4 "total" histone values.
  - provides several convenience functions for publication-quality graphics

Our normalization strategy is inspired by work Alex Kuo's group,
described in  this 2018 paper, which applies linear regression
normalization to cytof data:
